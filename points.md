Based on the requirement regarding Snowflake connections with AWS resources, here's an effort estimation breakdown for your JIRA change request:

1. **Analysis and Planning**: 3 points
   - Review current AWS resource configuration and Snowflake connections
   - Identify all affected Lambda functions and Glue jobs
   - Document current VPC configurations

2. **Implementation**: 5 points
   - Configure Lambda functions to use VPC networking
   - Update Glue jobs to use appropriate VPC
   - Test connectivity between resources
   - Update network security groups as needed

3. **Testing**: 3 points
   - Verify Snowflake connections work from each updated AWS resource
   - Regression testing to ensure functionality is maintained
   - Performance testing to check for any latency impacts

4. **Documentation**: 2 points
   - Update system architecture diagrams
   - Document new configuration requirements
   - Create runbook for future implementation

5. **Deployment and Verification**: 2 points
   - Phased deployment to production
   - Post-implementation verification

**Total Story Points: 15**

This represents a medium to large change requiring coordination between infrastructure, networking, and application teams. The implementation complexity is moderate, but thorough testing is critical to ensure no service disruptions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
